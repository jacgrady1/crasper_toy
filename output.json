In one study, college students were asked to each put on a pair of shoes—shoes with laces they would have to tie.\n 4. Now one group of students was told that they would be observed.\n 5. The second group, however, didn't know they were being observed.\n 6. The students who were aware that they were being watched actually tied their shoes much faster than the students who thought they were alone.\n 7. Other studies confirm the same is true even when we're learning new activities.\n 8. Let's say someone is learning a new task—for example, learning how to type.\n 9. When they're conscious of being observed, they'll likely begin typing at a much faster rate than they would if they were alone.\n 10. But, and this is interesting, the study also showed that certain common behavior— things people typically do, like ...making mistakes when you're learning something new that behavior pattern will also increase.\n 11. So in other words, when we're learning to type, and we know we're being watched, we'll type faster but we'll also make more mistakes."

Well, typically people think of coins and paper \"bills\" as money ...but that's using a somewhat narrow definition of the term.\n 4. A broad definition is this:money is anything that people can use to make purchases with.\n 5. Since many things can be used to make purchases, money can have many different forms.\n 6. Certainly, coins and bills are one form of money.\n 7. People exchange goods and services for coins or paper bills, and they use this money, these bills ...to obtain other goods and services.\n 8. For example, you might give a taxi driver five dollars to purchase a ride in his taxi.\n 9. And he in turn gives the five dollars to a farmer to buy some vegetables.\n 10. But, as I said, coins and bills aren't the only form of money under this broad definition.\n 11. Some societies make use of a barter system.\n 12. Basically, in a barter system people exchange goods and services directly for other goods and services.\n 13. The taxi driver, for example, might give a ride to a farmer in exchange for some vegetables.\n 14. Since the vegetables are used to pay for a service, by our broad definition the vegetables are used in barter as a form of money.\n 15. Now, as I mentioned, there's also a second ... a narrower definition of money.\n 16. In the United States only coins and bills are legal tender—meaning that by law, a seller must accept them as payment.\n 17. The taxi driver must accept coins or bills as payment for a taxi ride.\n 18. OK?\n 19. But in the U.S., the taxi driver is not required to accept vegetables in exchange for a ride.\n 20.

The strategies they use can be subtle, uh...friendly forms of persuasion that are sometimes hard to recognize.\n 6. In a lot of ads, repetition is a key strategy.\n 7.

Instead, what usually happens is that when the statement \"plenty of room\" is repeated often enough, people are actually convinced it's true.\n 17. Um, another strategy they use is to get a celebrity to advertise a product.\n 18. It turns out that we are more likely to accept an advertising claim made by somebody famous, a person we admire and find appealing.\n 19. We tend to think they are trustworthy.\n 20. So...um...you might have a car commercial that features a well-known race car driver.\n 21.

Now I am sure when I saw him, I said something like \"Uncle Pete, what a surprise! How nice to see you!\" \n 5. Anyway, my wife was standing next to me, and according to her, I wasn't really aware of this, my eyes got really wide and I broke into a huge big smile.\n 6. She said I was actually jumping up and down like a little boy.\n 7. Well, anyway, later that evening Uncle Pete told me how very very good he felt when he saw how happy I was to see him.\n 8. But compare that with this, my daughter, she is six.\n 9. We were building a birdhouse together last week.\n 10. And I was showing her how to use a hammer and nail.\n 11. And of course, stupid me, I wasn't being very careful and I smashed my thumb with the hammer.\n 12. Boy did it hurt!\n 13. I almost felt like screaming, but I didn't want to upset my daughter, so I said, \"Don't worry, honey, it's nothing.\"\n 14. Meanwhile, I was shaking my hand as if that would stop my thumb from hurting, and my face was contorted in pain.\n 15. My voice was trembling too.\n 16. So even though I told my daughter I was okay, I'm sure she didn't believe me because she kept asking me if I was okay."

Actually no...um.... this is a little embarrassing.\n 8. I think I left my class schedule back in my dorm.\n 9. Hm.... not a good thing to do on the first day of classes,\n 10. Yeah...so I'm not sure where my class is.\n 11. I think I remember it was supposed to be here in Smith Hall.\n 12. There is a computer for student use in the student center.\n 13. You can go over there, look it up and check the room number.\n 14. But...you'd have to hurry.\n 15. Hm ... that's not a bad idea.\n 16. I could check my schedule for the whole rest of the day at the same time.\n 17. I don't know where any of my other classes are either, but I don't wanna be late, make a bad impression with the professor on the first day.\n 18. It's actually my very first class - Introduction to Psychology.\n 19. Psychology? Oh! Okay, you're definitely in the right building.\n 20. And if it's introduction to Psychology, it's gonna be a big class, in which case it probably meets in a big lecture hall.\n 21. There're only three lecture halls in the building, one on every floor.\n 22. Just check each floor till you find yours.\n 23. There is an elevator, so you should be able to move fast.\n 24. Yeah, but I don't know what the professor looks like or anything.\n 25. How will I know whether it's my class or not?\n 26. It'd be sort of embarrassing, sticking my head into each lecture hall, asking if I was in the right place.\n 27. Well... you might luck out and find it the first time."

    "listeningTxt": "1. In order for art to communicate, to appeal to the emotions or the intellect, it has to combine various visual elements to express meaning or emotion.\n 2. It's really the visual components of the work, things like color, texture, shape, lines and how these elements work together, that tell us something about the work.\n 3. Artists combine and manipulate these visual elements to express a message or to create a mood.\n 4. Think about how a painter might use color, for example.\n 5. You all know from experience that different colors appeal in different ways to the senses and can convey different meanings.\n 6. An artist chooses certain colors to evoke a particular mood and make powerful statements.\n 7. The color red, for example, is a strong color and can conjure up strong emotions, such as extreme joy or excitement or even anger.\n 8. Blue, on the other hand, is considered a cool color.\n 9. Blue colors tend to have a calming effect on viewers.\n 10. Another visual element important to art is texture.\n 11. By texture, I mean the surface quality or feel of the work - its smoothness or roughness or softness.\n 12. Now, of course, in some types of art, the texture's physical - it can actually be touched by the fingers.\n 13. But in painting, for example, texture can be visual.\n 14. The way an artist paints certain areas of the painting can create the illusion of texture, an object's smoothness or roughness or softness.\n 15. A rough texture can evoke stronger emotions and strength, while a smooth texture is more calming and less emotional.\n 16. As I said earlier, artists often combine elements to convey a message about the work.\n 17. Take a painting that, say, uses a lot of strong colors like reds and oranges and uses brush strokes that are broad -wide, sweeping brush strokes that suggest a rough texture.\n 18. Well, these elements together can convey a wilder, more chaotic emotion in the viewer than, more than, say, a painting with tiny, smooth brush strokes and soft or pale colors.\n 19. Artists use these visual effects and the senses they arouse to give meaning to their work."

Well, yeah, they do.\n 6. But my cousin was in the program a few years ago, and she said that it's very different to cook for a lot people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook for classmates.\n 7. Why is that?\n 8. Well, in class, you can take your time, but cooking for more people there is more pressure.\n 9. I mean you are in a rush, people are waiting, and it might be easy to make a mistake with all that stress.\n 10. Then they'll think you are a bad chef right?\n 11. Absolutely.\n 12. So, OK, its good practice.\n 13. But what about the extra cost?\n 14. Well, look at it this way.\n 15. You've eaten at some of the fancier restaurants in town right?\n 16. Well, there are some great places to eat around here.\n 17. Well, these students, they'll be making fantastic meals and it's gonna be cheaper than going out to one of those restaurants.\n 18.

You know, the phone has bright colors and they show kids having a good time with their friends.\n 5.

But the same company will make a different commercial to be shown during, say, a program about business or a business news show.\n 7.

In other words, what motivates us to do what we do?\n 4. Well, in studies of motivation, psychologists distinguish between two very different types.\n 5. Our reasons for doing something, our motivations, can be extrinsic, in other words, based on some kind of external reward like praise or money.\n 6. Or they can be intrinsic, meaning we engage in the activity because it pleases us internally.\n 7. Both create strong forces that lead us to behave in certain ways.\n 8. However, intrinsic motivation is generally considered to be more long-lasting than the other.\n 9. As I said, extrinsic motivation is external.\n 10. It's the desire to behave in a certain way in order to obtain some kind of external reward.\n 11. A child, for example, who regularly does small jobs around the house, does them not because she enjoys taking out the garbage or doing the dishes but because she knows if she does these things; she'll be given a small amount of money for doing them.\n 12. But how motivated will the child be to continue doing the work if her parents suddenly stop giving her money for it.\n 13. With intrinsic or internal motivation, we want to do something because we enjoy it or get a sense of accomplishment from it.\n 14. Most people who are internally motivated get pleasure from the activity so they just feel good about doing it.\n 15. For example, I go to the gym several times a week.\n 16. I don't go because I'm training for a marathon or anything. I just enjoy it.\n 17. I have more energy after I exercise and I know it's good for my health so it makes me feel good about myself.\n 18. And that's what kept me going there in the past five years."
